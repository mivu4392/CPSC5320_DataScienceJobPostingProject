767,Data Scientist,VNS Health,3.6,"Overview

About Our Team: The Data Science Team provides advanced analytical support across VNS Health’s family of corporations. We leverage big data to develop insights and to support strategic decisions for the agency. Meaningful, appropriate use of data is central to the success of our organization. We are looking for an ambitious data scientist to join our team.

Responsibilities

About the Role:
The Data Scientist will join a core group of analysts who play an important role in generating strategic insights across the VNS Health organization in these four applications of data science:
Clinical - “Who is going to get sick? What can we do to prevent or mitigate these health events? When is the best time to implement these actions?” This application of data science examines the drivers of clinical outcomes; analyzes opportunities for managing risk-based populations; evaluates programs and interventions that aim to improve patient outcomes.
Quality – “How is quality of care measured and how is it related to patient outcomes? Where are opportunities to improve the quality of care to our patients and members?” Our data scientists serve as subject matter experts on healthcare quality measurement and risk adjustment; use predictive modeling to identify patient populations in need of clinical interventions; identify opportunities for improvement in clinical processes that can lead to improved quality of care.
Operational – “How can we optimize our business operations in order to be more efficient? How do we deliver our services in order to improve the coordination of care for our patients and members?” This application of data science focuses on efficiency and optimization of business practices in order to improve patient care; uses techniques including time series forecasting and geospatial analysis to address business problems such as staffing and scheduling; analyzes opportunities for business growth within the organization and predicts and forecasts expenses.
Policy – “What is the impact of health care policy on our patient population? On our most vulnerable patients and members? How will changes in reimbursement policy affect the way we deliver patient care? What partnerships can we develop in order to ensure that our patients and members continue receiving optimal care?” Our data scientists are well-versed in healthcare policy; analyze areas for meaningful value investments that focus on improving health outcomes while saving money; use predictive modeling to identify high cost and high need patient populations who may be impacted most by changes in health policy.
You Are:
Looking for an opportunity to perform hands-on data analysis and modeling to solve a wide variety of business problems while working alongside clinical/business stakeholders
Driven by curiosity and a passion to learn, you thrive in situations where you can bring clarity to ambiguous and multi-faceted problems
A logical thinker who is comfortable learning new programming languages and computing applications independently
Obsessive about streamlining data and modeling processes; if you find you or your colleagues doing something several times, you create a standard reproducible workflow
Love the challenge of exploring new data sources while practicing a healthy skepticism about data; when you find data that looks wrong, you are emotionally compelled to figure out why
Have a desire to use your analytical skills to make measurable impacts on the lives of patients
Requirements:
MS in statistics, biostatistics, mathematics, econometrics, epidemiology, computer science, or other quantitative field
2+ years of professional experience in applied data analysis, interpretation, and prediction
Experience with statistical/mathematical software (e.g., R, Python) and data querying languages (e.g., SQL, PLSQL) with demonstrated ability to learn and wield multiple analytical tools
Solid understanding of relational databases
Demonstrated experience executing reproducible and rigorous analyses
Strong verbal, visual, and written skills, with experience communicating results of complex data analyses to non-technical stakeholders
Expertise in translating business needs into relevant data-driven deliverables and analyses
Excellent interpersonal communication skills and ability to work collaboratively across different teams

About Peek
1.1 billion people worldwide have preventable or curable vision loss, including 43 million who are blind. And rates are rising. Vision loss can have devastating effects on education, social status, and livelihoods. Simple, cost-effective treatments exist, like cataract operations or glasses. Further, the burden of most eye conditions is not borne equally. The majority of cases are in Africa and Asia, where eye care services are limited and people travel long distances to reach hospitals.
Peek Vision is a social enterprise that powers eye health programme providers to strengthen systems and service delivery with a software and data intelligence platform.
We are dynamic, impact-driven and award-winning . Our solutions for school & community eye health providers include:
1. Population-level eye health surveys
2. Programme design
3. Software
4. Data insights
For a brief introduction explaining how Peek powers school and community eye health programme providers to make unmet eye health needs visible, watch this Introducing Peek Vision video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ch20cw3Rdc
Peek Capture is a smartphone app that allows non-specialists - such as teachers and community health workers - to conduct vision screening and eye health surveys in homes, communities and schools. It integrates the visual acuity check from our award-winning Peek Acuity Android App, allowing anyone to check visual acuity using a smartphone.
Peek Admin is a web platform that displays the real-time data entered in Capture, allowing healthcare providers to understand where the need is greatest and how to improve services.
They are used to power our two main offers:
Peek for School and Community Eye Health Programmes
We use Peek Capture to help eye health providers reach communities and join up local services, while data from Peek Admin helps ensure those who need treatment are reached.
We offer our public health expertise to adapt the solutions to local needs and help partners analyse the data for iterative improvement.
Peek for RAAB7
RAAB (Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness) is a rapid survey methodology developed at
ICEH (International Centre for Eye Health) to identify the prevalence of eye health issues in a given population. Identifying population need is the first step to advocating for and designing impactful programmes.

397,Data Scientist,Ntropy Network,3.7,"Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).

As an early member of our data science team, you will help
- push the limits of what can be done with data.
- build the team and drive the direction of the company.
- shape our product and culture.
- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.

The following are required
- the tools: Python, Pandas / Polars, Matplotlib, sklearn, etc.
SQL and fundamental database operations.
- recognized open-source contributions and/or top performance in data competitions (Kaggle, Numerai, etc.).
fluency in statistics and probability.

944,Data Scientist,PerfectRec,3.7,"About PerfectRec
PerfectRec is a machine-learning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good, personalized recommendations without exhaustive research. We are starting with electronics, then other products such as cars and clothing, but ultimately we'll expand into other, more complicated decisions such as where to live or work. (Since you're reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.)

We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. And making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money. We hope to attract billions of users, collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches, and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves.
We're solving the problem by combining actual human subject-area experts with machine learning to help everyone — regardless of their expertise — find their perfect product, quickly. To do that, we guide users through a series of questions about what they're looking for. After each answer, we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations. Ultimately, we will get more information about a user's specific needs from a few quick multiple-choice questions than Amazon or Google can deduce from a search query and their past browsing data. This will enable us to make better recommendations tailored to each user's unique needs.
A Small Team Where You Can Have A Big Impact
PerfectRec is a small, early-stage startup where you can have a big impact. Our founding team has experience building successful startups and working at big organizations, like Google, Amazon, Twitch and UC Berkeley. We are growing fast, and looking for people who are excited to build a new product where they can have a big impact.
Founder Led, Founder Funded
Our CEO Joe Golden bootstrapped his first startup, Collage.com, to ~$100m in revenue and a successful exit in March 2021. He's using some of the proceeds from that sale to launch PerfectRec and give us a long runway of at least 3 years to build a great team and outstanding decision-engine.
Working At PerfectRec
We are an all-remote company, so we don't care where you live as long as you work well in a fast-paced, collaborative remote environment.
PerfectRec is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We are committed to finding the best candidates for every role and giving them the tools and guidance they need to succeed. Our all-remote structure enables us to recruit anywhere in the world, so our talent pool isn't limited to a few big cities, and our asynchronous structure allows our team to work when it's best for them. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.
Learn more about how we work and our differentiating values.
What You'll Bring
Strong sense of ownership. Ownership is taking responsibility for the outcomes of a task or project. You'll relish these ownership opportunities and ensure that tasks, projects, or the team are making positive forward progress.
Clear and concise communication. Building software is a team sport that relies heavily on great communication. You'll be responsible for clear, thoughtful, and concise written and verbal communication. This includes the ability to give and receive feedback with empathy and understanding whether in a code review or a 1:1.
Willingness to teach and learn. We're always evolving with new tools and practices. You'll be willing to jump in and learn unfamiliar technologies while also bringing others along with you. Mentorship and helping others learn are important parts of achieving this.
Creative problem solving. Creating a decision engine that can make recommendations across wide ranging domains is hard, and the potential data sources are limitless. You'll be able to evaluate and explore existing sets of data, suggest new sources of data, and be able to build models that learn from this data in novel ways.
Balance of perfection and pragmatism. Software has a lot of trade-offs and ways to solve problems. You'll be able to recognize and balance the trade-offs between long-term system health and bringing value to customers faster. Your tooling choices will reflect ability to solve the problem the best way and not just the latest and greatest.
What You'll Do
Create and explore datasets for powering recommendations, working closely with domain experts.
Prototype models for making recommendations in new domains.
Identify ways to evaluate and compare competing models.
Add new capabilities that are shared between models in different categories.
Solve technical problems across the stack and contribute to all parts of our code base, including creation of our internal machine learning library.
Share your expertise and experience to grow with the team.
Collaborate with product, design, and engineers to understand customer needs, design solutions, and prototype, launch, and iterate.
Build a product that is genuinely loved by users and respects their time.
Relevant Experience
We believe that everybody has the ability to learn and grow. So, relevant doesn't mean required or that you need everything on the list (this isn't a Pokédex). If you've used other tools, languages, and frameworks that are similar to what is listed, please apply! We only list specific tools so that you know the tech stack you're walking into.
Python or R.
Exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
Classical machine learning techniques like classification, regression, regularization, and cross-validation.
sklearn, Keras (or other deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch).
Recommender systems, including learning-to-rank.
SQL.
Technical writing.
Salary & Benefits
We believe in offering generous compensation and benefits tailored to our all-remote workplace. We pay well because we want to work with highly motivated people that will help make the company successful.
Pay Range and Level of Role
$130,000 - $300,000 salary and stock options which vest over 4 years. We are hiring data scientists with different levels of experience. Compensation is based on background and experience.
Benefits
100% remote and no cost-of-living pay cuts. We want you to work where you work best and we are not going to ""adjust"" your pay if you move somewhere with a lower cost of living.
We pay 100% of your and your dependents' healthcare premium in a high-quality, national PPO plan for US-based employees. For international employees, we will work with you if you're not covered by your national health plan.
We will buy the office equipment you need to succeed. Lots of companies are miserly about equipment. We are not going to do that because your time is valuable.
401k with generous matching. Once we have 20 employees, we'll set up a 401k program with generous matching.
Generous PTO. We trust everyone to take time off appropriately for themselves. We're pro-regular vacations - not taking regular breaks isn't good for individuals or the team. Once we have 20 employees, we will establish a more formal PTO policy.
Worry-free sick days. If you're sick, take the time off to get well. Just let your manager know as soon as practicable.
Free products that we're reviewing. We are becoming product experts together, and we will send you cool stuff like monitors and TVs as we add new recommendation lines. (Unfortunately, we probably won't be able to do this for cars.)",about perfectrec perfectrec is a machinelearning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good  personalized
