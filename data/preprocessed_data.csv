where to live or work   since you re reading this  our nonml based recommendation is that you really consider working here  we are starting with smartphones  laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products  spammy search results  fake reviews  and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest

to attract billions of users  collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches  and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves  we re solving the problem by combining actual human subjectarea experts with machine learning to help everyone regardless of their expertise find their perfect product  quickly  to do that  we guide users through a series of questions about what they re looking for  after each answer  we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations  ultimately  we will get more information about a user s specific needs from a few quick multiplechoice questions than amazon or google can deduce from a search query and their past
